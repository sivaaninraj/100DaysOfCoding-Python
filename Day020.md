## Statement
- Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to   
that number subjected to the conditions below. 
- It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input.
For every number in the given range, 
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
Otherwise, it prints the number.
REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
   - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
   - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
   - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
   - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
   
 ## Input
 ```

 ```
 ## Code
 ```
num = int(input())
rev = int(input())
for i in range(1,num+1):
  string = ""
  if i%3 == 0 or '3' in str(i):
      string = string+ 'Jugs'
  if i % 5 == 0 or '5' in str(i):
    if rev:
      string = 'Mugs'+ string
    else:
      string = string+ 'Mugs'
  if i % 7 == 0 or '7' in str(i):
    if rev:
      string = 'Pugs'+ string
    else:
      string = string+ 'Pugs'
  print(string or i)    
 ```
