## Statement
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input.
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
Otherwise, it prints the number.
REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
   - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
   - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
   - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
   - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
   
   ## Input
  ```
  73 
  True
  ```
  
  ## Code
  ```
  import wordninja
num = input()
rev = input()
temp=""
if (int(num) % 3==0 or '3' in num):
  temp = temp+"Jugs"
if (int(num) % 5==0 or '5' in num):
  temp= temp + "Mugs"
if (int(num) % 7==0 or '7' in num):
  temp= temp+"Pugs"
if( rev == 'false' or rev=='0' ):
  print(num if temp=="" else temp)  
else:
  if temp=="":
    print(num)
  else:
    strr = ''.join(temp.split())
    strr=wordninja.split(strr)
    strr = strr[::-1]
    print("".join(strr))
  ```
    
## Output
    ```
    PugsJugs
    ```
