## Statement
```
Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).

For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. 

So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.  
```
## Input
```
3900

```
## Code
```
num= int(input())
hr = num//3600
sec= num//60
print(hr,sec)
```
## Output
```
1 65
```
