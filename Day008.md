```
## Code
```
import math
# get the x coordinate of Point 1
x1 = int(input())  
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
y1 = int(input())  
# get the x coordinate of Point 2
x2 = int(input()) 
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
y2 = int(input()) 

# Write the code to calculate distance between 
# the two points 
distance =math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1))
print(distance)


```
## Output
```
