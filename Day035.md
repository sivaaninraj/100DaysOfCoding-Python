## Statement
Given a list of numbers, print all its even elements. Use a for-loop that iterates over the list itself and not over its indices. That is, don't use range()

## Input
```
1 2 2 3 3 3 4

```

## Code
```
# Read a list of integers:
a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]
# Print a value:
# print(a)
for i in a:
  if i%2==0:
    print(i,end=' ')
```

## Output
```
2 2 4

```
